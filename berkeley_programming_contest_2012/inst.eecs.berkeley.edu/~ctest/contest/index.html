<H2>General Directions </H2>

<P> 
To set up your account, execute
<pre>
    source ~ctest/bin/setup
</pre>
in all shells that you are using.  (This is for those of you using
csh-like shells.  Those using <tt>bash</tt> should instead type
<pre>
    source ~ctest/bin/setup.bash
</pre>
Others will have to examine this file and do the equivalent
for their shells.)

<P>
<strong>Web Submission:</strong> Use our 
<a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ctest/contest/cgi-bin/submit.cgi">web interface</a> for submitting problems and seeing your results.  Try
it (you can still use "submit" as usual if it doesn't work). 
If your program
does not pass the sanity check, you will see a "REJECTED" status in the
"Look at Your Results" table.
Such rejected submissions do <em>not</em> count against you.

<P>
Put
each complete C solution into a file <i>N</i><tt>.c</tt>,
each complete C++ solution into a file
<i>N</i><tt>.cc</tt>, and each complete Java program into a file
<i>N</i><tt>.java</tt>, where <i>N</i> is the number of the problem.
Each program must reside entirely in a single file.
In Java, the class containing the main program for
problem <i>N</i> must be named P<i>N</i> (yes, it is OK to have a Java
source file whose base name consists of a number, even though it
doesn't match the name of the class).  Do <em>not</em> make class P<i>N</i>
public, or the Java compiler will complain.
Each C/C++ file should start with the line
<pre>
    #include "contest.h"
</pre>
and must contain no other <tt>#include</tt> directives, except as indicated
below.  Upon
completion, each program <i>must</i> terminate by calling
<tt>exit(0)</tt> (or <tt>System.exit(0)</tt> in Java).

<p>
When you have a solution to problem
number <i>N</i>
that you wish to submit, use
the command
<pre>
   submit <i>N</i>
</pre>
from the directory containing the source program.
Before actually submitting
your program, <tt>submit</tt> will first
compile it and run it on one sample input file.

<p>
All tests (for any language) will use the compilation command
<pre>
    contest-gcc <i>N</i>
</pre>
followed by one or more execution tests of the form (Bourne shell):
<pre>
    ./<i>N</i> &LT;  <i>TEST-INPUT-FILE</i> &GT; <i>TEST-OUTPUT-FILE</i> 2&gt; <i>JUNK-FILE</i>
</pre>
which sends normal output to <i>TEST-OUTPUT-FILE</i> and error output
to <i>JUNK-FILE.</i>
The output from running each input file is then compared with a
standard output file, or tested by a program in cases where the output
is not unique.
In this comparison,
leading and trailing
blanks are ignored and sequences of blanks are compressed to single
blanks.
Otherwise, the comparison is literal; be sure to follow the output
formats <i>exactly.</i>  It will do no good to argue about how
trivially your program's output differs from what is expected; you'd
be arguing with a program.
Make sure that the
last line of output ends with a newline.
Your program must not send any output to <tt>stderr</tt>; that is, the temporary
file <i>JUNK-FILE</i> must be empty at the end of execution.
Each test is subject to a time limit of about 45~seconds.
You will be advised by mail whether your submissions pass.

<p>
In the actual ACM contests, you will not be given nearly as much
information about errors in your submissions as you receive here.
Indeed, it may occur to you to simply take the results you get back
from our automated judge and rewrite your program to print them out
verbatim when your program receives the corresponding input.  Don't do
that.

<P>
All input will be placed in the standard input.
You may assume that the input conforms to any restrictions in the problem
statement; you need not check the input for correctness.  Consequently, you
C/C++ programmers
are free to use <tt>scanf</tt> to read in numbers and strings and <tt>gets</tt> to
read in lines.

<p>
<b>Terminology.</b>
The terms <i>free format</i> and <i>free-format input</i> indicate that input numbers, words, or
tokens are separated from each other by arbitrary whitespace
characters.  By standard C/UNIX convention, a whitespace character is
a space, tab, return, newline,
formfeed, or vertical tab character.
A <i>word</i> or <i>token,</i> accordingly,
is a sequence of non-whitespace characters delimited on
each side by either whitespace or the beginning or end of the input file.

<p>
<b>Scoring.</b>  Scoring will be according to the ACM Contest Rules.
You will be ranked by the number of problems solved.  Where two or
more contestants complete the same number of problems, they will be
ranked by the <i>total time</i> required for the problems solved.  The
total time is defined as the sum of the time consumed for each
of the problems solved.	 The time consumed on a problem is the time
elapsed between the start of the contest and successful submission,
plus 20 minutes for each unsuccessful submission, and minus the time
spent judging your entries.  Unsuccessful
submissions of problems that are not solved do not count.  As a matter
of strategy, you can derive from these rules that it is best to work
on the problems in order of increasing expected completion time.

<!--  AFTER CONTEST, WHEN SCORES AVAILABLE 

<H2>Contest Standings</H2>

<p> The results are in from the 2012 Berkeley Programming Contest.
The following list shows number of problems solved, the total
submission time of the solved problems (in minutes from the beginning
of the contest, with a 20-minute penalty for each erroneous
submission of a problem that is eventually solved), and the number of erroneous submissions.
