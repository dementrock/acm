% Problem: editdist
In an effort to develop a system to check for plagiarism, a client
asks you to develop a program that measures how different two texts
are from each other.  Specifically, given two texts (strings) $A$ and
$B$, he'd like to be able to compute the minimum number of characters
that need to be added to and/or removed from $A$ to get $B$ (or
equivalently, the total number of characters that must be added to $A$
and $B$ to make them equal).  For
example, if $A$ is ``\verb*|written word|'' and $B$ is
``\verb*|kitten purred|'' we can first delete 4~characters from $A$ to get
``\verb*|itten rd|'' and then add 5~new ones to get $B$, for a total of
9~characters.  Alternatively, we can add 4~characters to $A$ to get
``\verb*|wrkitten wopurred|'' and add 4~different ones to $B$ to get
the same thing.
We'll say that the {\it dissimilarity} of $A$ and $B$
is~9.

Write a program to compute the dissimilarity of texts of up to~1000
characters.
The input consists of pairs of strings, with each string on a single
line.
For each pair, print one line containing the dissimilarity between the
texts.

\paragraph{Example:}~

\begin{tabular}{r | r }
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Input} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Output}	 \\
