% Problem: bees
[From the 1999 ACM ICPC]
Professor B. Heif is conducting experiments with a species of South
American bees that he found during an expedition to the Brazilian rain
forest. The honey produced by these bees is of superior quality
compared to the honey from European and North American honey bees.
Unfortunately, the bees do not breed well in captivity. Professor Heif
thinks the reason is that the placement of the different maggots (for
workers, queens, etc.) within the honeycomb depends on environmental
conditions, which are different in his laboratory and the rain forest.

As a first step to validate his theory, Professor Heif wants to
quantify the difference in maggot placement. For this he measures the
distance between the cells of the comb into which the maggots are
placed. To this end, the professor has labeled the cells by marking an
arbitrary cell as number 1, and then labeling the remaining cells in a
clockwise fashion, as shown in the following figure.

For example, two maggots in cells 19 and 30 are 5 cells apart. One of
the shortest paths connecting the two cells is via the cells 
$19\rightarrow7\rightarrow6\rightarrow5\rightarrow15\rightarrow30$, 
so you must move five times to adjacent cells to get
from~19 to~30.

Professor Heif needs your help to write a program that computes the
distance, defined as the number of cells in a shortest path, between
any pair of cells.
The input consists of several data sets in free format,  each consisting of two
integers $a$ and $b$ ($a, b \le 10000$), denoting numbers of cells. The
integers are always positive, except in the last set where $a=b=0$.
This last set terminates the input and should not be
processed.

For each pair of numbers $(a, b)$ in the input file, output the distance
between the cells labeled $a$ and $b$. The distance is the minimum number
of moves to adjacent cells to get from $a$ to $b$.
