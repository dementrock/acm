% Problem: survey
[From the 1993 ACM ICPC]
A subdivision consists of plots of land with each plot having a
polygonal boundary. A surveyor has surveyed the plots, and has given
the location of all boundary lines. That is the only information
available, however, and more information is desired about the plots in
the subdivision. Specifically, planners wish to classify the lots by
the number of boundary line segments (B=3,4,5,...) on the perimeters of
the lots.

Figures 1 and 2 show two hypothetical subdivisions. In Figure~1 there
are~12 boundary line segments, and in Figure~2 there are~27. The
sample input file below contains the data for these two test cases.
The plot in the upper left hand corner of Figure~2 has one line
running from (16,16) to (17,18) and another from (17,18) to (19,22).
Thus this lot has a perimeter comprising 5~boundary line segments,
though geometrically the lot is a 4-sided region. Similarly the
perimeter of the plot in the upper left hand corner of Figure~1 
comprises 6~boundary line segments, though the lot is pentagonal in
shape.

Write a program that will take as input the surveyor's data and
produce as output the desired information about the nature of the lots
in the subdivision.
The input file consists of several data sets in free format. 
Each data set begins
with the number of line segments ($4\le N \le 200$)
in the survey. There follow $N$ groups of 
four integers each representing the Cartesian $(x,y)$ coordinate
pairs giving the end points of a boundary line segment. The input file is
terminated with a~0.

Each data set corresponds to a rectangular subdivision whose
boundaries are parallel to the $x$ and $y$ axes (as in Figures 1 and
2.)  Boundary line segments in the input file do not extend past
corners of lots.  For example, in Figure~1 the surveyor must survey
from the point (10,41) to (15,41) and from (15,41) to (20,41) rather
than surveying the entire line (10,41) to (20,41).  At least one
boundary line segment in each lot lies on the subdivision's bounding
rectangle.

For each data set, provide output listing the number of lots for each
number of boundary line segment counts ($B=3,4,5,\dots$). Do not
include in your output those values of $B$ with no
members. The output for each data set will begin with a line
containing an appropriately labeled data set number, as shown in the
example.
Output for
successive data sets will be separated by a blank line.
