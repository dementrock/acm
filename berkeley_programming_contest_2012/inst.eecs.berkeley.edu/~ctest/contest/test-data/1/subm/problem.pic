% Problem: distances
A transportation planner is interested in knowing the maximum distance
one must travel to get between any two points in a country (that is,
the maximum of all the shortest distances between pairs of cities) and
wants you to develop a program to do so.  
For example, consider this simple road system, where all roads are
bidirectional:

\medskip
.PS
define city { ellipse wid 0.5*$2 ht 0.25 $1 at Here }
define roadwe { line from $1.e to $2.w "$3" above }
define roadns { line from $1.s to $2.n "$3~" rjust }
SF: city("SF", 1)
move to SF.n + (-0.1, 1); Eu: city("Eureka", 1.3)
move to SF.e + (0.5, 0.5); Sa: city("Sacramento", 2)
move to SF.s + (0.4, -2); LA: city("LA", 1)
move to SF.e + (5, -1); SaF: city("Santa Fe", 2)
move to LA + (0.4, 1.5); Fr: city("Fresno", 1.2)


roadns(Sa, SF, 88)
roadns(Eu, SF, 271)
roadns(SF, LA, 381)
roadwe(SF, SaF, 1146)
roadwe(LA, SaF, 874)
roadns(Fr, LA, 219)
.PE
\box\graph

\medskip
\noindent the maximum distance would be that between Eureka and Santa
Fe: 1417 miles.

The input to your program will consist of one or more sets of data in
free format.  Each set starts with an integer, $N$, indicating the
number of road segments between cities.   There then follow two city
names (containing no embedded blanks) followed by a positive integer distance.
There is at most one road between any pair of cities and no road from
a city directly to itself.  There will be
no more than~100 cities.
The last set is followed by the integer 0.

For each set, output the maximum distance in the format shown in the
example.
